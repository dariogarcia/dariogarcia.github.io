### Comedy is...

Comedy is a serious matter. Comedy (good comedy) can improve your health and wellbeing, making it the only genre that doctors may prescribe. However, doing (and thus, finding) a good comedy is hard. To complicate it further, everyone has it's own sense of humour, which makes comedy something not necessarily universal. As a result, when you find a comedy show which rings your sense of humour, it fills you with joy. It is like finding a treasure at the bottom of the sea. Unexpected & rewarding.


### A familiar feeling

Sitting in the sofa, with a grin tatooed in your face, you found youself thoroughly enjoying a comedy show. When all of a sudden, a feeling of familiarity grows in you. This sketch rings a bell. This character, dialoge or scene has a brilliant flavour that you tasted not long ago... Indeed. Good comedy shows are most often than not related to one another. Creators get inspired by other creators, or the same creator turns out to be behind two or more great shows. Sometimes, great minds simply think alike. And this is something we can use in our favour.

### A Map

Here we share map of comedy shows. Shows we consider to be objectively good, original and fullfilling. If possible, watch them all. But, alas, some people have a distinct taste, or a packed agenda. For those, we recommend to follow the associations. Links between shows specify shared humour, comedy style or theme. If you love a show in this map, you are definely going to enjoy those directly connected with it.

### Honorable Mentions

There are a lot of shows that were considered and discarded for this map. Most weren't good enough. A few were too reundant with some already there. Here you can find a list, for your own peace of spirit (if your favourite show wasn't in the map, is most likely going to be here). Beside each entry in this list of runner-ups, we add the show in the map we consider to be closest to it. This way, even if you have not seen any on the map, you can still get into it.
