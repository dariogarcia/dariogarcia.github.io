This is a cooperative game which combines aesthetic taste and understanding how others think. Originally conceived as a board game, Beautiful Empathy can easily work as an app. The game has no scoring system, and the main outcome is a mosaic, created collaboratively by all players. It usually takes between 20 and 35 minutes to play a game, although higher player counts can increase the playtime. At the end of this page you can see a sample of the mosaics created by playing the game.

### Rules

The best way to understand Beautiful Empathy is to read the rules (see below), which are very short. Short story even shorter, each player is a painter, who has a set of colors available. In each turn the current painter decides between two words to complete a sentence, and another player must guess that choice. Based on the number of responses, the painter gets a new color (or not) and can paint more or less squares in a shared mosaic.

Really, take a look at the rules. They are ridiculously short.

### Prototype

To test the game properly, we developed a computer version of it using Python and tkinter. Below you can see screenshots of the game in action. This version contains all the functionalities of the final game, but is not polished enough to be distributed. If you would like to try it, or if you are interested in the game in general, contact us.
