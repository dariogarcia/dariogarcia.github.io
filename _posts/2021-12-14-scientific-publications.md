We propose a new structure for scientific reviewing, publication and dissemination. To do so, we first identify the main problems in how research works today.

### Scientific Issues:

A significant part of today's scientific research (particularly the one originating at public institutions) is driven by the need to publish. The value of a researcher is determined by the yearly number of scientific papers written, by the reputation of the journals or conferences where those papers are published, and by the number of researchers that reference (i.e., cite) those publications in their own work. The first factor values quantity, not quality. The second rewards elitism, and puts lots of power on the hands of a few editors. The third is a measure of scientific relevance, but not of scientific quality. This far from perfect ecosystem has caused systemic problems in science. Such as:

* Opaque Evaluation: Current paper evaluations (i.e., journal/conference reviews) are rarely published, removing all responsibility and accountability from anonymous reviewers. This may lead to subjective, or plain arbitrary reviews, which in turn result in unfair decisions. Once a paper is published, readers are unaware of the issues found by evaluators, and have a harder time at identifying the limitations of published research.

* Unsuited Evaluation: Current evaluation is made by a few volunteers who may not be experts on the topic. These reviewers are forced to decide on the value of some piece of research without being fully aware of the state-of-the-art or its overall context.

* Unrewarded Evaluation: While having one of the most complicated and relevant roles in the scientific cycle, good reviewers (e.g., thorough, detailed, well-argued) are not rewarded. Additionally, posterior readers will not be able to benefit from their work due to opaque evaluation. Nonetheless, the first step in any scientific career is, or should be, reading and criticizing lots of papers to properly understand the current state-of-the-art, as well as the contents and structure of a good paper.

* Lack of Replicability: Replicability is not a must for most publications, and papers which try to replicate other's work are not favored for publication. However, replicability is an essential part of consistent research, and should be actively encouraged.

* Urge for Publication and Abandoned Research: Scientists are forced to publish several papers per year, regardless of their actual relevance. This favors short-lived research and the abandonment of challenging topics. The lack of consistent research makes it harder for science to reach the public.

* Scientific Paper Visibility is Unscientific: Papers visibility is directly affected by the impact factor of the journal or conference where it is published. Popular papers appear higher on search engines which results in a rich get richer process that impoverishes science. Journal/Conference impact factors supposedly determine their relevance, and consequently the visibility of published papers. However, impact factors are not a well-defined score, and are linked to a given journal/conference, not to the papers themselves. As such, it is useless for evaluating paper quality. At the same time, impact factors are used by institutions to evaluate the contributions of researchers. This leads researchers to pursue publications of those venues instead of producing quality research.

* Scientific Authorship & Contribution: Papers today may have from one author, to dozens of them. This dilutes the relevance of each researcher with regard to their own work, and complicates the task of attribution. It is often the case that one or more authors have not read the paper they sign, owning the right to authorship by rank or reputation.

* Limited State-of-the-art: Researchers are responsible for contextualizing their work on previous research, understanding the context and implications of their work. As the number of research works grows, it quickly becomes unfeasible to find, read and integrate every related work. 

Ok, so these are the problem. Seem like a lot. Let's see if we can find a few solutions.

### Solutions

* Transparent Evaluation: Evaluation of papers should be an open and continuous process. Readers should be aware of the criticisms, as well as the expertise of critics. Unsigned reviews should remain a possibility to foster free criticism, but that ought not to be the only way. Reviews should be reviewed, and reviewers should be accountable for their input.

* Idoneous Evaluation: For every research contribution there is a community, large or small, with the most knowledge on the topic. That is the community of researchers also working on the same area. These researchers will typically read and assess the relevance of papers in their field when working on their own research. This means the reading effort is already being done by the experts in the field, just not publicly. These experts on the topic are the best possible reviewers of a work, as they are selfishly interested in understanding every aspect of their related work.


* Recognized Reviewers: Writing good reviews takes time and effort, but their benefits are huge for science. Good reviewers (e.g., thorough, detailed, well-argued) should be acknowledged by the community, and should get proper recognition and reward.

* Replicability by Default: Contributions which cannot be replicated are of no relevance. Authors should be encouraged to facilitate the replicability of their work. Contributions replicating the work of others should also get proper recognition. The importance and visibility of papers should be directly related to their replicability.

* Perpetual evaluation: Research should be continuously under review. As a result of other people's contributions, research should be improved and extended. Authors should be encouraged to take into account and apply comments or findings made by the community. This would result in more complete contributions which would remain relevant for longer periods.

* Objective Paper Visibility: Paper visibility should be based on aspects like overall evaluation, citations, replicability, continued interest, and others. Research should be characterized and ranked by any combination of these factors.

* Explicit Author Contribution: Papers should have a limited set of contribution types. For example, original concept (the happy idea needed in many steps of the research project), design & refinement (the continuous planning and reconsideration of research) and implementation (conducting experiments, transforming ideas into reality).

* State-of-the-art Expansion: The creation of the state-of-the-art part of a paper could be done collaboratively. Authors of other works, or conocieurs of other research papers could enhance a new paper by contextualizing it beyond their original authors knowledge. This would provide a much richer background to papers, as well as identify potential side effects, applications and flaws of a research contribution.

### A New Platform for Research

The previously proposed solution is hard to implement in today's regime of private publishers and corporative venues. To implement all proposed solutions, we propose a new platform for research. In this system, there are two main types of contributions, original and enhancing ones. Additionally, there's authors, who can be attributed with either type of contributions.

#### Original Research Contributions

* An original research contribution is one which can be differenciated from the state of the art by itself. A work producing it's own hypothesis. 
* Each original research contribution has a reliabilty and relevance score.
* Whenever a new research contribution is submitted, it is assigned a base reliability and relevance.
  * Base reliability: A fixed percentatge of reliability is taken from each author's own reliability. The total is summed and counts as base reliability. This amount acts as a loan from each author to the submitted contribution. In practice, limits the amount of concurrent original contributions made by the same author. This lent reliability will be returned to the authors as reviews to the paper are submitted, covering up the base reliability.
  * Base relevance: Same as above. Instead of reviews, citations pay relevance back.
* Beyond it's base value, Reliability is increased through reviews. Each review submitted increases reliability, the volume depending on the review score and the reviewer's expertise and confidence.
* Reliability is not final (marked as confirmed) until the work has been independently replicated and/or reproduced.
* Relevance is gained by citations.
* Each original contribution has a clear set of authors, each with a percentual contribution. Certain categories are also attributed to specific authors (writing of manuscript, figures, tables, experimentation, footprint & ethics). All impact derived from an original contribution (reliability and relevance) is split among authors based on their contribution. Reviews can concern a specific part of contribution.

#### Enhancing Research Contributions

Enhancing research contributions are those that are built to make others more complete. Not with a purpose beyond that of improving another research contribution. There are several types of enhancing contributions:

* Reviews
* Meta-reviews
* State-of-the-art expansion
* Replication/Reproduction of original research
* Summarization and dissemination of research

Each of these contributions has an associated author. Although anonymity is optional, this would be unveiled if a red flag is raised on their work (e.g., prevaricating reviews, false replication report, plagiarism in reviews/summaries/dissemination produced)

#### Authors

* Authors should not be allowed to submit an arbitrary number of original contributions per year. The amount of quality research a person can do in a year is limited. 

* The number of original contributions an author may make should be related with the number of enhancing contributions that researcher makes on other people's original work. Enhancing contributions may be reviews, replicating other people's work, summarizing other papers or meta-reviewing. Clearly, a researcher who makes numerous and relevant enhancing contribution is in a better position to perform more and better original contributions.

* Authors should be encouraged to evaluate and take into account the enhancing contributions to their work, using it to improve their own research. Updated versions of original contributions should be released occasionally to meet the standards required by the scientific community and address concerns of special interest.


### The case of Artificial Intelligence

AI has a set of particularities that deserve to be discussed separately. For research done in this area, we must consider into account issues like model bias (particulary in machine learning). At the moment, there is no incentive for analyzing, rating and reinforcing or deleting bias from trained and released models. As a result, the majority of released models are not safe to use in practice, a feature that is also inherited by all models build on top (a very popular practice known as transfer learning).

In order to make the cost of bias worthwhile, we need to demand it and reward it. This must involve all actors involved in research:

* Funding agencies should include non-optional debiasing requirements on all calls made public.
* Research institutions which target AI models should include structural units focused on bias, to ensure no dangerously biased models or research is released.
* Publication venues and/or reviewers should demand debiasing proof and effort on all relevant research. Failing yo comply should entail desk reject.
