Boardgames are design by and for the human mind. It's us, defining our own challenges. 

To understand boardgames, we defined a questionnaire targeting game features directly related with playing experience. Our goal is to better understanding games and players. To do so we will mix these results with other databases, adding a bit of data analytics and/or machine learning in the process.

If you would like to contribute, go fill the questionnaire [HERE](https://forms.gle/bnCC8eArCZoe3qsg8).
You can add as many entries as you like. Just try to be faithful.

Thanks!
