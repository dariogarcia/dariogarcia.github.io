Under the rule of democracy, humankind succeds the most in terms of rights, freedoms, and overall social and scientific progress. However, democracy is fundamentally flawed, mostly due to the limitations of humans. These flaws were, are and will be used to undermine popular confidence and adherence to democracy, opening the door to alternative systems. Systems which promise flawless organization, but which generally entail regressive policies.

In here, we propose a set of principles to make the foundations of democracy stronger, focused on the weak spots of early XXI century systems. For this purpous is fundamental that all proposals be ideology-free, apolitic if you will, such that all individuals and organizations can adhere to them, and that none can oppose them rationally.

This work tries to improve current democracy. For a rather new proposal, more sustainable in the long run, which tries to evolve democracy to a new level, see [Meritocracy].

### Parties

Political parties are an essential part of democracy. Their role is underestimated, as often they become the main pathway to decision making. To avoid structural corruption, the funding of all parties should be open to the public. No hidden or anynonimous contributions, no access to mass media without regulation.



### Public Servants

Those individuals serving in public office have the highest of responsabilities. The will and well-being of others are put in their hands, with little to no guidelines or training (as opposed to medical doctors or teachers for example). 

## Public Servant, and nothing else

The importance of public servants motivates the role to be conducted in exclusivity. No other financially profitable activity should be compatible with being a public servant. This requires all public servants to be paid a decent salary, according to the dedication required. In exchange, this measure abolishes most sources of corruption, and reduces the apeal of public office.

A public servant can hold two public positions, as long as the time dedication of both is not bigger than a standard working schedule. Each position has a required dedication, and a decrease in dedication (e.g., half day) comes with a decrease in salary and expected outcomes, as well as a complementary public servant to take over the decreased (effectively sharing the responsibilities).

## A Public Servant is public

All assets owned by public servants should be public knowledge, before and after their service. This makes harder for corruption to pay off, while keeping obscure individuals from positions of influence.

## Public Servants accountability

For democracy to be able to hold public servants accountable, these must be individually elected (no party lists) and their actions reviewable (no secret voting). Public servants should always be free in their decision making. Mechanisms must be put in place to guarantee that not following party guidelines can only result in public reprecussions.

### Separation of Power

The independence between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government is a fundamental aspect of current democracies. To reinforce this separation, any individual or party is forbidden from participating in two of those branches concurrently. Each branch holds no power over the other ones, and there is democratic control of all three of them. Elections for two different branches cannot be held within a given time gap. Law enforcing agencies respond only to the executive branch. A specific enforcing agency should be created for the judicial if necessary.

### The 4th Power

Corruption should be actively and constrantly persued. Corruption levels in the early XXI century motivate the creation of a specific 4th branch, uniquely dedicated at the spotting of corruption. This branch should also be under democratic supervision (i.e., election system).

### Supervision and Technology

Current technology makes it easier to implement democratic controls. The public should have the right to veto any decision made by any branch, with the majority (percentatge of adepts) and participation requirements being directlyrelated to the majority and participation of the government branch on the decision (percentatge of parliament vote). The public should also have access to direct contribution to the legislative branch.
