I've been a parent forever. The first thing to know about parenting is that it occupies every space available. And that includes your memory. Technically speaking, I've been a parent 16% of all my lifetime. But it feels like 3 lifetimes. In this time, I've learnt a few tricks, tips, and inside information. I wish to share this with all sorts of parents: potential, noobs, and professionals.

* Being a parent entails constantly losing discussions in which you are obviously right. All the time. To understand and experiment with the feeling, go to any webpage full of people who are your opposite in opinions. Get into a discussion with some douche, and let them win. Now do it every day. A sort of Fight Club thing, but with hurt feelings and shattered self-esteem instead of broken bones.

* Parenting is the hardest thing I've ever done. By far. Be prepared for failure and focus on little victories. You will make mistakes, constantly, and big ones too. Always look ahead and try to get better at parenting. If anything else fails, be passive or walk away.

* You'll have problems, and occasionally find a solution that actually works. Know that it won't last long. Kids are evolving problems, and solutions work briefly. You still need to find solutions, constantly, so keep at it.

* Get used to half bananas, and melting icecream. You'll eat lots of it. Say goodbye to the tender part of anything. And try not to starve. Feeding kids can be exhausting, always make an extra effort to feed yourself properly.

* The Grand Canyon and a nearby park they have never been to are equally amazing to kids under 4. Plan your activities and holidays with that in mind.

* Don't bother trying to get kids to steadily look at cameras. Focus on making sure all adults look the way they should. No blinking allowed. Shoot a lot of pictures and you may get a good one.
