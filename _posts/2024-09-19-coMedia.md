title: coMedia. A new platform for indexing and retrieving content
date: 2024-09-19 00:00:00 +0300
description: Media is expressed in an increasing variety of formats, many of which are poorly indexed by traditional search engines. New media is often independent of webpages, which calls for a new generation of content retrieval systems. This is the motivation for coMedia, a collaborative repository of media items. Through coMedia, users can keep a diary of their opinions on multi-media content, as well as finding new content that fits their needs. Through an LLM-based encoding of both media descriptions, opinions and queries, coMedia can produce high quality matches for the most expressive natural language requests.

coMedia is a universal platform for keeping track of your favourite media, offering an AI based search engine to find new content in a flexible manner in a collaboratively built data base. To define such a system, three distinct concepts come into play: 

* Second brain
* Search engine
* Asocial network

These three technologies provide interesting functionalities for context representation and retrieval, but have also relevant limitations on their own. coMedia exploits their complementary features, to create a new generation of information storage and access. The glue that puts them together are Artificial Intelligence tools, mostly for the generation and matching of textually aligned representations.

## Second brain

The enourmous amount of media we consume daily makes it impossible to keep track of all content we find worth revisiting. Second brain applications aim to solve that, by providing storage and organization solutions based on bookmarks, tags, and annotations. A powerful diary of all things that matter. Unfortunately, the effort it takes to use second brain tools is high, and adherence is limited. This situation could be improved if users were to get additional returns from their efforts, further motivating them. 

coMedia goes beyond simply storing links. It builds a rich definition of the content you've engaged with, and uses it to power a collaborative retrieval system. A text-based query system allowing you to perform the most expressive requests: "I want a tv show for my teenage son to help him with sex education. Should be fun to watch, and promote responsibility and respect." Or rather "I want a podcast or audio series about history to listen while I do the home chores (cooking, cleaning, ...). Something immersive and enriching". Anything you need.

## Search engine

The variety of media formats we consume keeps on growing. Podcasts, books, short videos, cartoons, social media accounts, comic books, stream sessions... are all now common forms of production and distribution of content. And yet, most of this media does not have a strong presence in the world wide web. It is therefore hard to find through traditional search engines, that index webpages. A few of those, the lucky ones, are spread across a variety of specialized search engines, without centralized access.


coMedia provides a unified endpoint for all media. With text-based descriptions, and the combined contribution of all users, every content can be made accessible and properly represented.

## Asocial network

Social networks are powerful tools for building collaborative knowledge bases, allowing for the sharing of contents and opinions. Current social networks are however dominated by the need to create an audience as to increase ones the visibility. That is because the priority pushed in these platforms is to be seen, read and followed.

coMedia provides a collaborative representation of media, but removes the motivation for attention seeking by focusing on content instead of users.


# coMedia features

The two main functionalities of coMedia are the storage of personal interests and opinions with regards to multi-model content, and the retrieval of such content through flexible text-based requests. A proof-of-concept prototype is currently available in [github](https://github.com/dariogarcia/coMedia).
