title: coMedia. A new platform for indexing and retrieving content
date: 2024-09-19 00:00:00 +0300
description: Media is expressed in an increasing variety of formats, many of which are poorly indexed by traditional search engines. New media is often independent of webpages, which calls for a new generation of content retrieval systems. This is the motivation for coMedia, a collaborative repository of media items. Through coMedia, users can keep a diary of their opinions on multi-media content, as well as finding new content that fits their needs. Through an LLM-based encoding of both media descriptions, opinions and queries, coMedia can produce high quality matches for the most expressive natural language requests.
